  withot written any class in react. 

* when HOOKS are not exist in react then we need to write the class component of the for managing state or use lifecycle method for it it
  make code very complex to understand and for get deficulties for written the logics of the code. 

* So, Hooks provide us a functionalies for mange the state and lifcycle menthod under the functional component.      
    * 1- Functional component - It is the nothing the peice of code that's we write in the reactjs 

       ex - function welcome(){
        return (<>
        <h1> So here welcome is the functional component </h1>
        </>)
       }

    * 2- Lifecycle method - it is the special type of method that is run into different phages of the react there are theree phases of
          lifecycle in the react 

          Lifecycle ke 3 Phases 
            1-Mounting Phase
            Jab component pehli baar DOM me render hota hai.

            2-Updating Phase
